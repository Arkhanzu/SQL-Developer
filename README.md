# SQL Developer
In this project, we used the features of the web server solution stack package XAMPP, and the user friendly SQL Developer to create our own database with customized data.
## Prerequisites
There are a few programs you will need to make your database.
```
Xampp
```
```
SQL Developer
```
```
JDBC Driver
```
Once these are installed, we can move on to creating the database.
### Using XAMPP to create the database
Once you launch the XAMPP Control Panel you'll be welcomed with a few Modules to administrate.  We are interested in the **SQL and Apache Modules**. 
```
Click on the START button, where it says actions, for both modules.
```
```
Then click ADMIN to be taken to the PHPMyAdmin site with your localhost, where you'll be able to create and edit your own databases.
```
### Creating the database
On the left menu, click on the New option to create your new database.  Assign it a name and click create.
```
Then, create the tables you'll want defined in the database and define their number of columns.
```
```
Define each column, with its type, length, attributes, etc. Depending on what you need.
```
```
To create a new table, simply click on the New button inside your Table dropdown menu, on the left tab menu.
```
``` 
Repeat this process for each table you want to create inside your database.
```
## Connecting to your database
First, you'll need to add the JDBC Driver into your SQL Developer database.  To do this:
* Click on the Tools tab
## Inserting data into your tables
To insert data into a table you'll need to use the SQL Developer program.  We'll be using the worksheet to type in code to insert the data.
* Type in the clause that you wish to run
```
Insert
```
```
Delete
```
```
Values
```
Etc.
